# Catan Python Game

Welcome to the Catan Python Game project! This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular board game Settlers of Catan. The project is primarily focused on the backend logic of the game and serves as a foundation for future development, including integrating reinforcement learning agents for strategy optimization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main Python files:

1. **boardSetup.py**: This file defines the game board, its initial setup, and basic functions that interact with it. It sets up the Catan game world, including hexagonal tiles, resource tiles, numbers, and more.

2. **Table.py**: In this file, players are defined, and it contains the logic for player actions and how they interact with the game board. All legal moves and game rules are implemented here, allowing players to build settlements, roads, and perform other game actions.

3. **Catan.py**: This is where the actual Catan game logic resides. It brings everything together, manages the game flow, and allows players to take turns, handle resource distribution, and progress through the game.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust Catan game engine in Python. It currently lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) as it's designed for headless gameplay. The main focus is on creating a solid backend structure that can be integrated with reinforcement learning agents.

## Future Development

While this project focuses on the backend, future development may include:

- Integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more accessible to human players.
- Developing reinforcement learning agents that can play the game and optimize strategies.
- Expanding the game rules and features to support various Catan expansions and custom rule sets.
